ScalaFreesound is a library to query the Freesound audio database ("freesound.org":http://freesound.org). As the Mootcher API is currently discontinued, this takes an approach based on the FreeSound quark for SuperCollider by Batuhan Bozkurt ("www.batuhanbozkurt.com/news/freesound-class-for-supercollider-released-as-a-quark":http://www.batuhanbozkurt.com/news/freesound-class-for-supercollider-released-as-a-quark). Big thanks to Batuhan!
